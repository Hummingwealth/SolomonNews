 <h2>Study Shows You Should Skip Bananas in Smoothies</h2>
<figcaption>
<details>
 <summary class="read-more">read more</summary><p>Research helps maximize the health benefits of fruit smoothies. If you’re blending a smoothie to boost your health with flavanol-rich berries, you may want to leave out the banana. New research suggests that adding banana could significantly reduce the health benefits you’re hoping to gain.
In a study published in Food and Function, scientists tested how a naturally occurring enzyme, polyphenol oxidase, affects the body’s ability to absorb flavanols. This enzyme, responsible for the browning that occurs when fruits are cut or bruised, is found in many fruits and vegetables but is especially abundant in bananas.
Bananas Slash Flavanol Uptake by 84% The study, led by researchers at the University of California, Davis in partnership with the University of Reading, found that adding a banana to a berry smoothie reduced the absorption of flavanols by a striking 84%. For comparison, participants who took a flavanol capsule absorbed significantly more of these beneficial compounds.

 <h2>Train to busan next entertainment world movie.</h2>
<figcaption>
<details>
 <summary class="read-more">read more</summary><p>After years of The Walking Dead and countless zombie movies and TV shows, it can be tricky to find a truly gripping entry in the genre. But Netflix just released one of the best zombie movies ever made, and it’s worth a watch even if you’re burnt out on undead horror.

Train To Busan is a South Korean thriller that mixes terrifying zombies, cowardly betrayal and some genuinely great characters with something a lot of these types of movies are sorely lacking: A lot of heart. The film first released back in 2016, but it remains one of my favorite zombie films of all time. Directed by Yeon Sang-ho, the film stars Gong Yoo as Seok-woo, a workaholic father and fund manager. His daughter, Su-an (Kim Su-an) wants to spend her birthday with her mother in Busan. Feeling guilty over missing his daughter’s singing recital, Seok-woo grants her wish and they board a train at Seoul Station.

Things very rapidly start to spiral when a sick woman boards the train and attacks a train attendant. The woman was already infected and had turned into a zombie, and the train attendant turns as well. Soon, more passengers are turning and things are just as bad in the city.

 <h2>Top 10 banks in the world in 2025:</h2>
<figcaption>
<details>
 <summary class="read-more">read more</summary><p>The global banking industry continues to hold a dominant presence worldwide, with institutions managing assets worth trillions of dollars. According to a report by Statista, the sector’s net interest income is projected to rise to $8.94 trillion by 2025.




However, the global financial market experienced significant volatility and fluctuations, largely influenced by growing concerns about a potential global recession and uncertainty surrounding US President Donald Trump’s extensive tariff policies.
The United States of America-based JP Morgan Chase is the world’s largest bank in terms of market capitalisation, and is also the largest bank in the US in terms of total assets.

 <h2>Books That Will Teach You More Than Any College Degree
By Steve Burns</h2>
<figcaption>
<details>
 <summary class="read-more">read more</summary><p>A college education is valuable, but sometimes, the most transformative learning happens outside the classroom. Certain books contain profound and applicable wisdom that rivals—or even exceeds—what you might learn in four years of higher education.
These five exceptional works span disciplines and offer insights that can reshape your understanding of the world and yourself. Here are five books that will teach you more than any specialized college degree can.
1. “How To Read A Book” By Mortimer J. Adler And Charles Van Doren
First published in 1940 and revised in 1972, this classic remains essential because it teaches something surprisingly absent from most formal education: the art of reading itself. Adler and Van Doren outline four progressive levels of reading that transform how we interact with texts.
Elementary reading helps us understand the basics of what’s on the page. Inspectional reading allows us to grasp the structure and main arguments quickly. Analytical reading delves deeper into understanding and evaluating the author’s claims. Finally, syntopical reading—the highest level—enables us to compare different texts on the same subject to form our understanding.
